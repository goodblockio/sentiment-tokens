Sentiment tokens for eosio, ethereum blockchains

Sentiment tokens are a new blockchain token standard meant to allow issuers to label other addresses or accounts with persistent tokens representing sentiment or opinion. These are ideal for single-issuer ratings or multi-issuer aggregate sentiment tokens such as Like, Trust or Respect.

The Sentiment token paper offers a thorough description: [_Like, Trust and Respect: Tokenizing Sentiment and Opinion on the Telos Blockchain_](https://github.com/goodblockio/sentiment-tokens/blob/master/Like%20Trust%20Respect%20-%20tokenized%20sentiment%20paper%20v1.pdf).
